## Opening  : Getting artistic with code

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Venturing into the unknown is scary, but fun things happen when you try new things. Seb will show you that it's rewarding to get out of your comfort zone and blur the boundaries between artist and coder. He'll be talking about his recent experiments with lasers for his digital fireworks display, PixelPyros, and of course, expect some dangerous live demos.</dd>

## Building a Pyramid: Symfony Testing Strategies

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>The last few years have seen a huge adoption of testing practices, and an explosion of different testing tools, in the PHP space. The difficulties come when we have to choose which tools to use, in what combinations, and how to apply them to existing codebases. In this talk we will look at what tools are available, what their strengths are, how to decide which set of tools to use for new or legacy projects, and when to prioritise decoupling and testability over the convenience we get from our frameworks.</dd>

## Symfony and Drupal 8: Changing the world one community at a time

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>In some parts of the PHP community, Drupal has a bit of a reputation problem. As a massive, global open source Content Management Framework that has a history stretching back to the turn of the millenium and a most procedural code base- some might say there's a "Drupal Way" of doing things. The next major release of Drupal, Drupal 8 (which could be just days away at the time of Symfony Live) replaces many legacy systems with Symfony components and this is leading to a cultural shift in the Drupal Community. In this session, we'll look at: Which Symfony compontents Drupal has adopted and why?; Has the integration of Symfony made Drupal more accessible to those outside the community?; How has the Drupal community reacted to Symfony? ;Unexpected side effects?; What lessons can be learned for Symfony if other projects take this approach?</dd>

## Puli: PHP's Next Package Revolution

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>The development of Composer packages is thriving. But many packages are developed for a specific framework. You're using no or a different framework? Tough luck. Puli, a new toolkit built on top of Composer, is a step to fix this problem. With Puli, you can create packages that can be enabled in your project (Plug 'n Play) simply by running "composer install" - independent of any framework. Are you ready for the future of PHP?</dd>

## Hello, PSR-7

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>PSR-7 HTTP Message Interface has been kicking around in one form or another since March of 2012. Get a brief history of how PSR-7 evolved from its humble beginnings as a simple HTTP client interface to the game-changing PHP-FIG proposal we have today. Learn how to work with the HTTP Message Interfaces and how they will be used by frameworks in the not to distant future. Find out what it will mean to have a healthy ecosystem of PHP software all speak HTTP the same way. Say hello to your new best friend in PHP, PSR-7.</dd>

## Doctrine 2: To Use Or Not To Use

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Using Doctrine 2 can be a very rewarding experience, extremely frustrating or anything in between. To be a happy Doctrine 2 user requires attention and willingness to compromise. In this talk I will show how to use Doctrine defensively, common pitfalls that hurt maintainability and when to avoid Doctrine altogether.</dd>

## Modernising the Legacy

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>No one likes to work with the legacy projects - it's not fun. There are no specs, there are no behat examples and you're afraid to touch it. The customer may not have time or budget to spend on rewriting it from the scratch, but is likely to keep asking for the new features. Learn how to work with the legacy code, how to add new features without breaking existing ones. Learn to use Symfony components to support building sustainable features.</dd>

## Hexagonal architecture - message-oriented software design

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Commands, events, queries - three types of messages that travel through your application. Some originate from the web, some from the command-line. Your application sends some of them to a database, or a message queue. What is the ideal infrastructure for an application to support this on-going stream of messages? What kind of architectural design fits best? This talk provides answers to these questions: we take the *hexagonal* approach to software architecture. We look at messages, how they cross boundaries and how you can make steady communication lines between your application and other systems, like web browsers, terminals, databases and message queues. You will learn how to separate the technical aspects of these connections from the core behavior of your application by implementing design patterns like the *command bus*, and design principles like *dependency inversion*.</dd>

## The IoC Hydra

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Dependency Injection seems to be the most popular way of Inverting Control flow in PHP applications. Lets stop for a bit and ask a question - is it the only and the best answer for all the problems? What about almighty Events or not so popular in PHP world Aspect Oriented Programming? How does frameworks fit in there? In this talk we will have a look into pros and cons of different ways in which we can Invert the Control of our applications. We will investigate how frameworks like Symfony help us achieve that goal and what makes framework a framework. It turns out that some of the common practices are not the best choices and during the talk speaker will highlight why is that a case.</dd>

## Real-time Web Apps & Symfony. What are your options?

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Real-time is becoming the life blood of applications. Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Google Docs and many more apps have increased user expectation to demand real-time features. Features such as Notifications, activity streams, real-time data visualisations, chat or collaborative experiences instantly keep users up to date and enable them to work much more effectively. So, how do you build these sorts of features with Symfony? This talk will cover a number of options Symfony (and PHP developers in general) have for building real-time features within their apps and the pros and cons of each to help choose which is the best solution for you.</dd>

## How Spotify.com transitioned to Symfony

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Spotify.com has always been powered by PHP. However it was difficult to maintain our custom, non-MVC based code. With ongoing business needs to cope with, we needed the ability to migrate gradually. Symfony gave us the ability to do that. The talk will focus on how we approached this problem, how we solved it using the unique capabilities of Symfony, and where we are going next.</dd>
